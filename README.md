# Thesis title: Sorting visualizer using multiple sorting algorithms

## Description:

Sorting visualizer using multiple sorting algorithms is a thesis project that aims to solve a real world problem by becoming a platform that can help users sort their non-malformed CSV and structuraly uniform JSON array files by using bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort as the sorting algorithms. The sorting process of these algorithms will be saved and will be visualized using our visualizer. We added the visualizer to accomplish our second goal which is to provide a platform that can help the users abstract the sorting process of their selected sorting algorithm. This is going to be helpful for those who are interested in learning how their file was sorted.
